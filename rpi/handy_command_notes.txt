Here is a list  of linux commands that will come in handy.

	$ df -h 
	
	Shows the amount of free space/space used on each system partition. 
	The -h switch shows labeled block sizes that are easier to read 
	(i.e. xxGB  | xxMB | xxKB | xxB ).

	
	$ du -shc 
	This command can be used to show the size of files and directories.
	-s shows a summary rather than a listing for each file.
	-h shows labeled block sizes.
	-c shows a grand total for the directory from which the command is run. (semi redundant to run with -s).
